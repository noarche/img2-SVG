#  ꧁꧂ Functions

  Batch convert image files into vector (.SVG) or icon (.ico) files easily and quickly. 

     This app creates a new directory to save SVG and ICO files. The new directory is located inside the directory you choose to process. Original images remain unchanged.


#  ꧁꧂ How to use

  Click img2-SVG-ICO.exe and you will be prompted for a directory, select the directory containing images you want to convert. 

  The process runs in the background. 

  When the process is finished running you will be prompted with information of how many files were converted.

## 🛡️ Is this a virus❔

No it is not a virus, that is a false positive. Anything compiled with pyinstaller will be flagged as potentially malicious. Pyinstaller is what turns the .py file into a .exe file and allows people to run python scripts as portable applications without the need to install python or any dependencies.  

Please scan the actual source, the file that ends with '.py' -  It will with no doubt be 100% clean on virustotal.  That being said I have provided instructions on how to build your own exe from the file you know is clean.

🛡️ Tip for all questionable applications: 

*Running the application via [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) or similar app will virtualize and protect your OS as if it was running on a virtual machine - [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) can be used with any application or installation package thus another great tool to have.*
